# Introduction
Agentic systems are often characterized by features by **autonomy**, allowing them to act without constant human oversight;
**proactiveness**, initiating actions towards their goals and **reactiveness**, responds effectively to changes in their environment. 
They are fundamentally **goal-oriented**, constantly working towards objectives.\
A critical capability is **tool use**, enabling them to interact with external APIs, databases or services - effectively reaching beyond immediate canvas.\
They possess **memory**, retain information across interactions, and can engage in communication with users, other systems, or even other agents operating on same or connected canvases.

Effectively realizing these characteristics introduces significant complexity. Hence, we need agentic design patterns to breakdown these complexities.

## Why patterns matter in Agentic Development
> How does the agent maintain state across multiple steps on its canvas?
> How does it decide when and how to use the tool?
> How is communication between agents managed?
> How do you build resilience into system to handle unexpected outcomes or errors?
